# Assignment: Multi-Threading

## Description
The objective of this assignment is to multiply 100 random matrices of size \(1000 x 1000\) with a constant matrix of size \(1k \times 1k\). After performing the multiplication, the assignment requires generating a result table, graph, and CPU usages.

## Task
1. Multiply 100 random matrices of size \(1000 x 1000\) with a constant matrix of size \(1k \times 1k\).
2. Generate a result table displaying the time taken for each number of threads.
3. Generate a graph depicting the relationship between the number of threads and the time taken for matrix multiplication.
4. Record and present CPU usages for each configuration.

## Instructions
- Clone this repository to your local machine.
- Install the necessary dependencies, if any.
- Execute the provided code for matrix multiplication.
- Record the time taken for each number of threads and CPU usages.
- Generate the result table and graph as specified.
- Update the README with any additional instructions or notes, if needed.

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib
- Multiprocessing module (for parallelization)

## Usage
1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the assignment files.
3. Run the Python script for matrix multiplication.
4. Analyze the generated result table and graph.
